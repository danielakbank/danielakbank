### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel, a mobile app developer with five years of experience building projects in Java with Android Studio and Dart with Flutter. Currently, I'm pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Hull, where Iâ€™m expanding my technical expertise and learning the latest advancements in these fields.

Through my hands-on projects and studies, I've developed a solid work ethic, a keen eye for detail, and a continuous drive to learn and improve. My ability to work independently has been key to deepening my skill set and successfully managing projects end-to-end.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and letâ€™s connect if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss ideas in app development, data science, or AI!
