### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel, I have been working on movile app development for five yearsnow, while stil studying on getting my master in Data science and Artificial intelligence at the University of Hull. Had my own projects, coded mostly in Java using android studio and Dart Using Flutter. But I have learned alot, both at school and while working on the app development. I believe that my work ethic, attention to detail, and willingness to learn new skills complement each other exceptionally well. Futhermore, my ability to work independently without supervision has been instrumental in developing these skills.
